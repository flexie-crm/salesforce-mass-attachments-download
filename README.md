# Salesforce Mass Attachments Download

A Python script to **efficiently download Salesforce attachment files** in bulk. This script is designed to handle large volumes of files while keeping track of progress, allowing recovery in case of failure. A `run` file is included to automatically install the required environment and dependencies.

## Features

- **Mass Download**: Fetch and download large numbers of Salesforce attachments.
- **Resumable**: Keeps track of downloaded files and resumes from where it left off if interrupted.
- **Automatic Setup & Execution**: A `run` script is included to install dependencies, set up the environment, and execute the script.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically retries failed downloads and logs errors.
- **Multi-threaded Downloads**: Utilizes multi-threading (`ThreadPoolExecutor`) for faster downloads.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Implements retry logic with increasing delay to handle API rate limits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Salesforce API credentials (`username`, `password`, `security_token`)
- `pip` for dependency management

3. **Configuration Parameters:**
   - `MAX_THREADS = 10` â†’ Number of parallel downloads.
   - `RETRY_COUNT = 5` â†’ Number of retry attempts for failed downloads.
   - `SALESFORCE_API_VERSION = "62.0"` â†’ API version.
   - `BATCH_LIMIT = "200"` â†’ Maximum records per request (up to 2000 allowed by Salesforce).
